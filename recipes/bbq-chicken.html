    <h2>Grilled Chicken covered with delicous BBQ Sauce</h2>
    <p>This scrumptious version of sticky chicken took me years to perfect. But I am ready to release the recipe to the public.
        It takes about 10 minutes of prep, and 50 minutes to cook and yields 4 servings, perfect for the family.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>1/2 cup prepared barbecue sauce</ul>
    <ul>1/4 cup soy sauce</ul>
    <ul>1/4 cup red wine</ul>
    <ul>1/4 cup maple syrup</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon chili powder</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon dry mustard powder</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon garlic powder</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon onion powder</ul>
    <ul>1 teaspoon ground cumin</ul>
    <ul>4 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</ul>
    <ul>1 tablespoon cornstarch</ul>
    <ul>1 cup water</ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol><strong>Step 1</strong> Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</ol>
    <ol><strong>Step 2</strong> Whisk together the barbecue sauce, soy sauce, red wine, maple syrup, chili powder, dry mustard powder, garlic powder, onion powder, and cumin in a bowl until thoroughly combined. </ol>
    <ol><strong>Step 3</strong> Place the chicken breasts into a 9x13-inch baking dish, and pour the sauce over the chicken. Turn the chicken pieces over in the sauce to coat both sides.
    </ol>
    <ol><strong>Step 4</strong> Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear, about 40 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the baking dish, and keep warm.
    </ol>
    <ol><strong>Step 5</strong> Pour the remaining sauce into a saucepan, place over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Whisk the cornstarch and water together in a small bowl until smooth. Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the sauce; reduce heat to a simmer, and allow the sauce to thicken, whisking constantly. Return the chicken to the dish, and pour the thickened sauce over the chicken to serve.

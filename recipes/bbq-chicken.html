    <h2>Grilled Chicken covered with delicous BBQ Sauce</h2>
    <p>This scrumptious version of sticky chicken took me years to perfect. But I am ready to release the recipe to the public.
        It takes about 10 minutes of prep, and 50 minutes to cook and yields 4 servings, perfect for the family.
